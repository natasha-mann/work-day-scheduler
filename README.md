## About the Project

In this project I had to use jQuery to add functionality to a day planner website. The requirements were that on load of the page the current date should be displayed in the header, and each hour of the planner should be colour coded to show which hours are in the past, which is the current hour and which are in the future. The user can add text to each hour and can save this into local storage. When the page is refreshed, the stored text is still visible on the page.
