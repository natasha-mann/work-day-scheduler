## About the Project

In this project I had to use jQuery and moment.js to add functionality to a day planner website. The requirements as follows:

- On load of the page the current date should be displayed in the header.
- Each hour of the planner should be colour coded to show which hours are in the past, which is the current hour and which are in the future.
- The user can add text to each hour.
- The input text can be saved into local storage.
- When the page is refreshed, the stored text is still visible on the page.
